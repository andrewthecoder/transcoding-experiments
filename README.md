Scalable Media Transcoding 
for Cross Platform Streaming
========================

#### Abstract
Video of all kinds is being consumed on a wider range of devices than ever before, and consumersexpect a high quality experience on every device without being made to wait. This demand forquality and speed across such a variety of platforms creates demand for better ways of managingand serving video les to improve user satisfaction. There are many challenges to overcome,and while current solutions have already solved these in a variety of ways, there is always roomfor improvement since existing solutions are not perfect.  This research aims to investigatecurrent solutions in depth, present a new solution centred aroundstreamingtranscodedvideoon demand in a scalable manner, and evaluate the cost-eectiveness and user experience gainfrom this method.
